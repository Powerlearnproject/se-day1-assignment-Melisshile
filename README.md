Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
=>Software engineering is a process of developing solutions using computer technologies. It applies engineering principles,methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It also involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages(e.g Fortran, C)
2. The establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The advent of structure programming in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
> Requirement
=>It's all about gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
> Design
=>It's about creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
> Implementation
=>It's about writing code and building the software according to the design specification.
> Testing
=>It's about conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirement.
> Deployment
=>It's about releasing the software to users or customers.
> Maintenance
=>It's about providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deplyment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
> Waterfall : sequential aproach with distinct phases(e.g. requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like waterfall. The example of a construction project like building a house with two bedroom fits this methodology, where we gather the requirements and get the design an then implement the project.
>Agile : Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. The example of a software project like a To-Do List Application, the project is based on need of the user and the need might change with time, it might be adding ot removing some features, and needs also updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
>A Software Developer is responsible of writing code and implementing software solutions.
>A Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible of ensuring software quality by designing and executing tesy plans.
>A Project Manager is responsible of overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of software project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
=>The importance of Integrated Development Environments and Version Control Systems is that they enhance productivity and collaboration. Integrated Development Environments provides code editors(a place where code can be written, debugged, and tested) for example visual studio, Eclipse, intellij IDEA, which makes the developer's work productive and Version Control Systems provide a place which can allow the tracking of changes in code and also coordinating work among team members examples JUnit, Selenium, Jest.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
>Changing requirements
=>to overcome changing requirements, there must be a nice and detailed planning 
>Tight deadlines
=>to overcome tight deadlines, a nice and detailed schedule of implemention must be clearly defined
>Technical debt
=>to overcome technical debt, the software engineer must always be update with everything around especially about new computer technologies


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
> Unit testing test individual components or modules of the software
>Integration testing test interactions between different components or subsystems
>System testing test the entire software system as a whole
>Acceptance testing test the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
=>Their importance in software quality assurance is that testing is a critical aspect because it fullfil the Quality Assurance by touching each and single part of software.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
=>Prompt Engineering is the art of formulating nicely and correctly in a high acurate specification on the question for the correct answer to be given. It allows the AI to generate the exact answer to your request.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
=>Example of a vague prompt: Translate this
=>improved : Translate this in English sentence to Spanish
=>It is very important to improve the prompt because it allows the AI to give the correct output.
